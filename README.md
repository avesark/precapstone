## Aves Ark (2023) Evolving Concerns Chronicle: Connecticut Birds Emerging Media Content; Data, Video, Animation, and Website Interface 

### Digital Media Design MLA Captone Project

Birds are often experienced as common, their annual return bringing the hustle to nest, feed, sing and breed. Unfortunately, their numbers are dropping so quickly that the populations are visibly less. AvesArk explores the impacts of the Twenty-first century world order on the Aves order. 

The inquiry seeks information about our local birds â€”traits, habitat, migration, current status data and the results of Conservation work to save them. Intent to engage people with the data as seen from stories composed with footage, animation, and descriptive audio aims to increase behavior fixes to reduce the threats birds face. Observing birds connects us to all life vulnerability and strengths. The topic of birds is serious. Their vitality is serious.
