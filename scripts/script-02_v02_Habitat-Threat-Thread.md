> Narration: Did you know there are fifty percent less birds on earth now than fifty years ago? [^1](http://)
> - Development has altered and destroyed much of the natural habitat particulaly for our shoreline birds
> - The importance of compromising how much land is designated for natural habitats for other species to survive and thrive is urgent. Awareness that there is even a problem seems less than urgent in the general public and media. There are many dedicated people who are aware and trying, but the task is as enormous as climate change. Have we gone too far, can we reverse course?

> - "North America has suffered a net loss of 30% of its birds. In other words, the total number of individual birds onthis continent is only two-thirds ofwhat it was just 50 years ago. That's 3 billion birds wiped out.
And this was at the hands of humans. There’s nothing natural about these declines." Ivan Phillipsen

Breeding Mallards in New England are relatively stable, although data supplied by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection reveal that the three-year rolling average of nesting pairs in Connecticut fell by 34 percent from 2000 through 2020—from an average of 17,823 to 11,676.” Paul Schmidt

> - "Experts have developed national and international conservation plans for waterfowl, landbirds, waterbirds,and shorebirds that defi ne conservation goals and objectives for priority species. In addition, Reports like theState of the Birds, State of Canada’s Birds, and Saving our Shared Birds highlight some of the majorchallenges facing bird conservation in North America today. Joint Ventures work with partners across NorthAmerican to help meet the goals and objectives of these conservation plans and address these challenges toensure a sustainable future for not just birds, but people, as well."
