> - Ospreys, like other raptors, were harmed by the pesticide DDT after it came into
widespread use in the late 1940s. DDT weakened eggshells of many birds, cracking them
when parents sat on them to brood.
> - Ospreys also lost valuable nesting habitat due to
coastal development. “Lots of government agencies, conservation groups and individuals met their needs by putting up nesting platforms,” said Andersen. “The osprey population is now abundant and
seems stable in Connecticut. It’s just an amazing success story.”

Meadows Marsh protect our coast from the effects of climate change, while hopefully fostering
continued thoughts of environmental conservation for all of Connecticut,” said Joe Gresko,
House Chair of the Environment Committee and State Representative from Stratford.
"This is an incredible accomplishment resulting from the work of so many to restore and
revitalize the marsh, protect wildlife, rebuild ecosystems, and combat the effects of climate
change. To see this project completed with the restoration of 34 acres of salt marsh is
wonderful and transformative. This could not have been done without the 12 students from
Stratford and Bunnell high schools who worked as Salt Marsh Stewards, as well as their crew
leaders and over 150 volunteers who gave their time. Our entire community shares our deepest
gratitude with all who invested in this project to improve CT's coastline and give our beautiful
native plants and wildlife the ability to thrive. I look forward to visiting with my kids and
grandkids, and seeing future generations learn about the importance of protecting and
preserving our coastline and salt marsh," said Connecticut Senate Republican Leader Kevin
Kelly."
